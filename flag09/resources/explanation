We can see 2 files : a binary and a file named 'token'

'cat token' gives us 'f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��'.
'./level09' gives us 'You need to provied only one arg.'
'./levle09 abcd' gives us 'aceg'

We can see that argument characters are being shifted depending on their index.
We create a python script that will do the opposite with the token.

    import sys

    i = 0
    token = ''
    for char in sys.argv[1]:
            token += chr(ord(char)-i)
            i += 1
    print(token)

chr() will return the value of an integer (chr(48) will return '0' as 0 is at index 48 on ascii table)
ord() will return the index of a character.
We do 'python /tmp/test.py `cat token`' to execute the script on the token.
We get a token 'f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq'.
We do 'su flag09' with the token as password and then launch getflag.
